            <p>We will have a potluck for both the light dinner on Tuesday and brunch on Wednesday. Please bring as much prepared food as possible since access to the kitchen will be limited. For the light dinner please no meat, dairy, or anything that will unsettle the stomach.</p>

            <p>On the left is a list of foods people are already bringing. Try to choose something not yet on the list so we don't end up with a bunch of kale and eggs! If for some reason you did not have time to bring food, donâ€™t despair! It's more important to arrive early to help with your activity, and then go to the the nearby grocery store.</p>
